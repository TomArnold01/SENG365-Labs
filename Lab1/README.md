To Run the contents of these files:

Go to the terminal and run:
node ./FILENAME.js
For some of theses files this will start running on a port, make sure that the port is free.

curl http://localhost:3000 -Method GET
curl http://localhost:3000 -Method POST
curl http://localhost:3000 -Method PUT
curl http://localhost:3000 -Method DELETE

curl http://localhost:3000/ADD_REST_OF_URL -Method POST
curl http://localhost:3000/ADD_REST_OF_URL -Method PUT
